 * every figure is a count, sum or average of stored records.

 * Each department gets the modules whose data concerns it (police records for the Police,
 * the hospital MIS for Government Hospitals, lakes and works for PWD, rain and IMD warnings for
 * the departments whose work rain drives, ...), then what its grievances are about (complaint
 * patterns) and its own work record from the grievance store. A source's window ends at its newest record, so a feed that
