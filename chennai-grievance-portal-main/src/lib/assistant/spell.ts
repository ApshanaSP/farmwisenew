/**
 * Typo correction for Ask District IQ, before anything reads the question: "incidnets in adyr" becomes

 * vocabulary (its places, incident categories, market commodities and the console's terms), only when one word is
 * clearly closest, and never when the word is a real English word (274,000-word list from the word-list package) or
 * romanised Tamil. Tamil script is left as typed. The card says what was corrected ("Understood as ..."), as a search
 * engine does.
