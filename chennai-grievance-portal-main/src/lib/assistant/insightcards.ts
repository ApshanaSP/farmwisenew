/**
 * "Insights for today": the top items from the console's own insights() (briefing attention

 * tools-first path as a question: numbers from the store, chart with "compared to what".
 * Ranking: the pipeline's priority, then recency, then the Collector's 👍/👎 on that insight.
 * On a department officer's console the insights are the same, for that department only.
